# Emotion-Analyzer
It's a text-based emotion analyzer. It is designed using rule-based NLP engine. It is designed to detect 4 types of emotions viz. joy, anger, sad and fear. 

This project I and my team (**Mr. Ganesh Mane, Ms. Deepa Upparwar and Ms. Kiran Bisht**), we call us as **"We know emotions team"**, have contributed to this project. I would like to thank **Mr. Bhushan Garware** for mentoring us for this work. We have developed this project for Technothon 2018 project presentation competition when we were at Persistent Systems Ltd. We were awarded with the best project in this competition.

**I would like to clearly mention that we were employees of Persistent Systems Ltd. at the time when we built this system and hence Persistent Systems Ltd. has copyrights for this project and hence re-using of this code is not allowed. I am uploading my own copy which is the last version before final submissions.**
